Description: The fInstrument class provides an abstraction layer over the
    various types of financial claims available in Rmetrics. The class exposes
    methods for computing NPV and the "greeks". With this class, you can
    perform calculations on a portfolio of financial instruments, without
    having to be concerned with the implementation details specific to each
    kind of instrument.
